                <p class="center small">Carbon Emissions and Global Warming</p>
                <br>
                <p>&emsp;Climate change is a global crisis that poses a threat to all life on our planet. One of the driving
                    forces behind global warming each and every one of our <b>carbon footprints</b>; the greenhouse gas emissions
                    we produce. The current trajectory of emissions is leading us towards a bleak future that is marked by 
                    unprecedented levels of environmental destruction and suffering. </p>

                <p>&emsp;The burning of fossil fuels is the primary source of carbon emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere 
                    and cause <b>permanent shifts in weather patterns</b>. Despite the indisputable evidence on the dangers of climate 
                    change and the general acceptance of its dangers, carbon continues to be emitted by individuals at an 
                    alarming rate. Engrained within our everyday activites, such as driving or consuming meat and dairy, 
                    lies substantial contribute to carbon emissions.</p>
                    
                <p>&emsp;Record-breaking <b>heatwaves</b>, more frequent and intense <b>natural disasters</b>, and <b>rising sea levels</b> threatening 
                    coastal communities mark the onset of the effects of climate change. Coupled with these environment impacts 
                    are social and economic problems, including food and water scarcity, displacement of people, and economic 
                    losses. Without urgent action to reduce carbon emissions, the our future is nonexistent.</p>

            <h2 class="center">OUR SOLUTION</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="center small">For the Calculation and Reduction of your Footprint</p>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp;EcoTracker is a way to accuratley <b>quantify your carbon footprint</b>, compare it to the carbon footprint
                of others, and measure your improvement or regression over time. Using our carbon calculator, you can determine
                how much any particular carbon emitting activity damages our environment.
            </p>

            <p>&emsp;After setting up an account and logging in, a logger will be available to document your carbon emissions 
                in real time. These measurement will be saved, and used to generate statistics to <b>track your emissions</b> hold
                you accountable for your contributions to our global struggle.
            </p>
                
            <p>&emsp;To encourage you to maintain lower carbon emissions, a task system has been implemented to walk you through
                sustainable practices in <b>bite-sized assignments</b> rather than forcing large commitments and lifestyle changes.

            <h2 class="center">THE GOAL</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="center small">The Necessary Action, Quantified</p>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp;Reversing or stopping climate change will require significant action on a global scale. The 
                Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees 
                Celsius above pre-industrial levels, carbon emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030 and <b>reach net-zero by 2050</b>. 
                This requires a rapid and large-scale transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, as well as 
                significant changes in land use and agriculture practices.
            </p>

            <p>&emsp;Individuals play a significant role in reducing carbon emissions by making changes to their daily habits 
                and lifestyle choices. According to the Global Carbon Project, the average carbon footprint per person is 
                approximately <b>4.9 metric tons of CO2 per year (16 tons in the US)</b>. Some estimates suggests that average carbon foorprints should be
                2 tons or less yearly, while the IPCC has recommended that global carbon emissions must reach net-zero by 2050.
            </p>
                
            <p>&emsp;Individuals need to lower their carbon footprints in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change and 
                ensure a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
